#Malware Analysis

This repository contains the tools that I use for malware analysis and the reports of malware samples that I have done for practice and for fun ofc.

!!! Please be careful when you try to download the malware samples they are quite pain in the ass if you aren't careful enough.

Just so you knwon most of the analysis is just static analysis(Reversing the malware to see it's code and all the basic stuff).

## Tools
1. OS's for malware analysis (Sandbox)
	- [Cuckoo](https://cuckoosandbox.org/)
	- Windows VM edition
	- [Remunx OS](https://remnux.org/#distro)

2. INetSim for network simulation
3. [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) - Open Souce Software Reverse Engineering suite by NSA Gov (<3).
4. Yara - `apt install yara` - used to identify files that meet certain conditions.
